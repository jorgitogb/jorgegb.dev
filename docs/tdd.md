# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

> Write the test first. Watch it fail. Write the code. Watch it pass. Refactor.

## The cycle

For every task in `tasks.md`:

1. **Red** — Write a failing test that covers the requirement `R<n>`. Run it. Confirm it fails.
2. **Green** — Write the minimum production code to make the test pass. Run it. Confirm it passes.
3. **Refactor** — Clean up the code while keeping tests green. Run tests again.

Repeat for every task.

## Rules

- Do not write production code without a failing test first.
- Do not skip the refactor step — clean code is part of the deliverable.
- Do not leave broken tests. If you cannot make a test pass, document the blocker and stop.
- Every test must reference its requirement (`R<n>`) in the test name or a comment.

## Test structure

- One assertion per test where possible.
- Test names describe behavior: `should_<expected>_when_<condition>`.
- Use real filesystem operations with temp directories, not mocks.
- Clean up temp directories in test teardown.

## Traceability

The implementer documents the mapping in `progress/impl_<feature>.md`:

```
## TDD log

### Task T1 (covers R1, R3)
1. Red: wrote `test_recent_default_limit` — fails ✅
2. Green: implemented `cmd_recent()` — passes ✅
3. Refactor: extracted `sort_notes()` helper — still passes ✅
```

## How TDD integrates with SDD

- The spec-author writes `requirements.md` (EARS) and `tasks.md` (checklist).
- The implementer follows `tasks.md` using red-green-refactor.
- The reviewer checks that every `R<n>` has a test, and that the test was written before (or in the same commit as) its production code.
- `CHECKPOINTS.md` section C7 validates TDD discipline.

## When TDD does NOT apply

- Pure configuration files (`.gitignore`, `opencode.jsonc`)
- Documentation (`docs/`, `README.md`)
- Template files (`.tmpl`)

These are validated by the reviewer's checklist, not by tests.
