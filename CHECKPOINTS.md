# CHECKPOINTS — Final state evaluation

> In multi-agent systems, the destination is evaluated, not the path.
> These are objective checkpoints that a judge (human or AI) can use to decide if the project is healthy.

## C1 — Harness is complete

- [ ] The 5 base files exist: `AGENTS.md`, `init.sh`, `feature_list.json`, `progress/current.md`, `ground-rules.md`.
- [ ] The 5 docs exist: `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/conventions.md`, `docs/specs.md`, `docs/tdd.md`, `docs/verification.md`.
- [ ] `./init.sh` exits with code 0.

## C2 — State is coherent

- [ ] At most one feature `in_progress` in `feature_list.json`.
- [ ] Every `done` feature has associated tests that pass.
- [ ] `progress/current.md` is empty or describes the active session.

## C3 — Code respects architecture

- [ ] `src/` contains only modules described in `docs/architecture.md`.
- [ ] No external dependencies in `requirements.txt` or equivalent that are not in the spec.
- [ ] No stray `print()` for debug, no TODOs without context.

## C4 — Verification is real

- [ ] `tests/` has at least one test per module in `src/`.
- [ ] `./init.sh` test block shows > 0 tests and all green.

## C5 — Session closed properly

- [ ] No untracked suspicious files (`*.tmp`, `__pycache__` outside `.gitignore`).
- [ ] `progress/history.md` has an entry for the last session.
- [ ] The last worked feature reflects its correct state.

## C6 — Spec-Driven Development

- [ ] Every feature with `"sdd": true` in state `spec_ready`, `in_progress`, or `done` has its `specs/<name>/` directory with 3 files: `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`.
- [ ] `requirements.md` uses EARS notation (see `docs/specs.md`).
- [ ] Every `done` feature with `"sdd": true` has all tasks marked `[x]` in `tasks.md`.
- [ ] Every `R<n>` in `requirements.md` is covered by at least one concrete test in `tests/`.

## C7 — TDD discipline

- [ ] Every test in `tests/` was written before (or in the same commit as) its corresponding production code.
- [ ] The implementer's `progress/impl_<feature>.md` documents the red-green-refactor cycle.
- [ ] No test exists without a corresponding `R<n>` in a spec.

**How to use this file:** A reviewer agent (`.opencode/agent/reviewer.md`) walks through each checkbox, marks `[x]` or `[ ]`, and rejects session closure if any boxes in C1–C7 are empty.
