# Ground Rules

Non-negotiable rules for this project. Selected during initialization.

---

## Immutable rules

- **human-approval-gate** — No feature moves from `spec_ready` to `in_progress` without the human explicitly saying "approved" / "go" / "aprobado" in the chat. No agent may mark a feature `done`. The human is the only entity that transitions status in `feature_list.json`.

## Active rules

- **one-feature-at-a-time** — Maximum 1 feature in `in_progress` state in `feature_list.json` at any time.
- **no-done-without-green-tests** — `init.sh` must exit 0 before any task is marked `done`.
- **approved-spec-before-code** — Every feature with `"sdd": true` in `in_progress` or `done` must have a `specs/<name>/` directory with `requirements.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md`.
- **progress-on-disk** — Agents write artifacts to files (`progress/`, `specs/`), not to chat. The human reads from disk, not from agent responses.
- **learning-mode** — When `docs/learning.md` exists, agents include brief explanations after major decisions. Disable by deleting `docs/learning.md` or adding `<!-- learning-mode: off -->` to `progress/current.md`.

## Optional rules (disabled by default)

- **conventional-commits** — Every commit follows `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` format. Types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci, build.
- **no-new-deps-without-adr** — Adding a new dependency requires an ADR in `docs/adr/` explaining the choice.
- **document-exports** — Every exported symbol has a one-line doc comment.
